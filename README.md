# TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

# TradingView Ticker Analysis

The TradingView Ticker Analysis script is a Python program that retrieves technical analysis data for a given ticker symbol from the TradingView website. It uses Selenium and ChromeDriver to scrape the necessary information and provides a summary of the analysis along with signal counts and an overall recommendation.

## How it Works

1. The script prompts the user to enter a ticker symbol.

2. It opens the TradingView website for the specified ticker symbol and retrieves the technical analysis data.

3. The script extracts the summary text, which represents the overall analysis, and appends it to the analysis list.

4. It retrieves the counts for sell signals, neutral signals, and buy signals from the counter elements on the webpage.

5. The script creates a DataFrame using the analysis data and adds the ticker symbol as a column.

6. Based on the signal counts, it determines the overall recommendation: "Sell" if there are more sell signals, "Buy" if there are more buy signals, or "Neutral" if the counts are equal.

7. The script prints the formatted output, including the ticker symbol, summary, signal counts, and overall recommendation.

   pip install selenium pandas webdriver_manager

3. Clone the repository or download the script file.

4. Open the script file in a text editor.

5. Make sure you have the Chrome browser installed on your system.

6. Save the changes to the script file.

7. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

8. Run the script using the following command:

   ```shell
